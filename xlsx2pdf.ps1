## Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, you can use the Stream parameter of the Get-Item cmdlet to detect files that are blocked because they were downloaded from the Internet, and you can use the Unblock-File cmdlet to unblock the scripts so that you can run them in Windows PowerShell.
##
## To execute without error, Run below command:
## ```
## Unblock-File .\ppt2pdf.ps1; powershell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -File .\ppt2pdf.ps1

    ## https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8755497/which-should-i-use-write-host-write-output-or-consolewriteline
    ##
    ## Write-Output should be used when you want to send data on in the pipe line, but not necessarily want to display it on screen. 
    ## The pipeline will eventually write it to out-default if nothing else uses it first. 
    ## Write-Host should be used when you want to do the opposite.
    ##
    # print to screen...
    Write-Host "Processing" $_.FullName "..."
    
    # Open it in PowerPoint
    $workbook = $xlsx_app.workbooks.Open($_.FullName)
